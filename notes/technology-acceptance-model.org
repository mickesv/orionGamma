#+BEGIN_QUOTE
TAM2 extended the original model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions including social influence
(subjective norm, voluntariness, and image), cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, and
result demonstrability) and experience. The new model was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The
results strongly supported TAM2 and explained 60 percent of user adoption using this updated version of TAM
(Venkatesh & Davis, 2000).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The questions in Part II were not only made based on Davis’s prior studies with modifications to fit the specific
context of the e-learning but also mainly adapted from the three studies for the objectives of the study: Lee, Cheung,
& Chen, (2005); Ndubisi (2006); and Malhotra & Galletta (1999). Part II consisted of four sub-sections, as follows:
perceived ease of use (PE), perceived usefulness (PU), attitude (AT), and behavioral intention (BI). The questions in
Part III were developed by the researcher to measure e-learning self-efficacy (SE).
