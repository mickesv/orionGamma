#+BEGIN_QUOTE
ORION addresses the following scientific grand challenge:

How to make decisions successfully for efficiently using software
components or services from different sources to develop competitive
software-intensive systems in relation to the trade-off between
functionality, time to market, cost, quality, legacy and risk?

The project addresses development of software intensive products and
services, including new development and building on existing assets
(systems, components, platforms, etc.).

** Orion Gamma
 - So far, focus has been on /Decision Process/
 - I wanted to introduce a /von unten/ perspective:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Background: Deciding between different components consist, among other
factors, of an assessment of each of the component candidates based on
a number of different properties. These properties include aspects
such as functional compliance, frequency of updates to the component,
"liveliness" of the development community surrounding the component,
but may also include aspects such as performance, reliability, and
cost of the component.

Objective: The objective of this study is to enable a quick and easy
assessment of components based on an initial (and extensible) set of
properties, and to evaluate whether such a component property
repository provides meaningful input for decision makers when deciding
which components to include into their products.

  - Search for Components in ~NPM~ and ~Github~
  - Enqueue (three levels down) for further information gathering
  - Scrape Github for more information
    - License
    - Stargazers
    - Forks
    - Tags
    - Issues
    - Commits
** Project Pulse

** TODO Condense Metrics
  - Scraping takes time and costs too much (Limit of 5000 API-calls per hour)
  - Manually analyse a collection of projects, look for patterns
  - Define /cheap/ Metrics to indicate current state of a project

* Future Steps

** TODO Industry Static Validation
** TODO Industry Validation
* Usefulness Measures
  - Licence
  - Responsiveness
  - Popularity
  - Liveliness
  - Stability - Functions/features added/removed/changed over time
  - Functionality - Functional value over time
  - Supportability - Response by development team to user needs
  - Longevity - Expected usability over time
  - General quality - What the metric says
  - Predictability - Ability to determine the functionality and quality in the future.
